<p>I&rsquo;m a recent graduate from Northeastern University&rsquo;s College of Engineering , where I earned my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science.

<p>Throughout my time at Northeastern, I completed three six-month co-op placements:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Full Stack Developer at HubSpot</strong>: As part of the Marketing Hub team, I collaborated with designers and product managers to build and maintain user-facing features for HubSpot&rsquo;s marketing automation platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Engineer at NVIDIA</strong>: I joined the AI Research team, where I worked on developing and implementing novel deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.</p>
